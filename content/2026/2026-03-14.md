# First Day in Beijing

Today I arrived in Beijing after a long flight. The city is bustling with energy, and I'm excited to explore what it has to offer.

## The Food

I had my first authentic Peking duck today. The crispy skin and tender meat were incredible. The restaurant was packed with locals, which I took as a good sign.

## First Impressions

The contrast between ancient temples and modern skyscrapers is striking. Tomorrow I plan to visit the Forbidden City and see more of the historical side of the city.
