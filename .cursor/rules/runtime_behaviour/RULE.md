### Navigation

Must work without JavaScript:
- Previous / next links
- Direct URLs per entry
- Index pages

Optional JS enhancements:
- Jump-to-date picker
- Keyboard navigation
- Smooth scrolling

URLs are the true navigation API.

---

### Reactions

- Anonymous
- Best-effort
- Approximate counts acceptable
- No identity or guarantees

Reaction data is disposable and non-essential.

---

### Subscriptions

- Email notifications only
- Site captures intent, delegates everything else
- No email storage on the site
- Clear opt-in and opt-out

Subscription failure must not affect reading.

---

### Performance & Privacy

- Content loads first
- Enhancements load later
- Minimal tracking
- No fingerprinting

You should be able to say:
> “This site remembers what you last read and nothing else.”
